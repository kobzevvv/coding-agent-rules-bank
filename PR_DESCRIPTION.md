# 🚀 Add Global Setup Functionality for Memory Bank System

## 📋 Overview

This PR adds global setup functionality to the Memory Bank system, allowing users to install the system once and use it across all projects without copying files to each repository.

## ✨ New Features

### 🔧 Automated Global Installation
- **`setup_global.sh`** - Automated script that installs the Memory Bank system globally
- Creates global directories at `~/.cursor/global-rules/` and `~/.cursor/global-modes/`
- Copies all rules and mode instructions to global locations

### 📚 Global Mode Instructions
- **`van_instructions_global.md`** - Global version of INITIALISE mode instructions
- **`plan_instructions_global.md`** - Global version of PLAN mode instructions
- Updated to reference global rules path (`~/.cursor/global-rules/isolation_rules/`)

### 📖 Comprehensive Documentation
- **`GLOBAL_SETUP_GUIDE.md`** - Step-by-step guide for global setup
- Includes troubleshooting, benefits, and quick reference
- Covers custom mode creation and usage instructions

## 🎯 Benefits

### ✅ One-Time Setup
- Install once, use everywhere
- No need to copy files to each repository
- Consistent workflow across all projects

### ✅ Easy Maintenance
- Update rules once, affects all projects
- Centralized configuration
- Simplified updates and improvements

### ✅ Project Isolation
- Each project gets its own `memory-bank/` directory
- Automatic creation on first use
- Project-specific context and progress tracking

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Global Installation Process
1. Creates `~/.cursor/global-rules/isolation_rules/` directory
2. Copies all rules from `.cursor/rules/isolation_rules/`
3. Creates `~/.cursor/global-modes/` directory
4. Copies all mode instructions to global location

### Mode Instructions Updates

- Maintained all original functionality
- Added global-specific implementation steps

## 📋 Usage Instructions

### For New Users
1. Run `./setup_global.sh` to install globally
2. Follow `GLOBAL_SETUP_GUIDE.md` to create custom modes
3. Use in any project by typing "INITIALISE"

### For Existing Users
- Can continue using project-specific setup
- Can migrate to global setup using the new guide
- Both approaches work simultaneously

## 🧪 Testing

- ✅ Global installation script tested
- ✅ Mode instructions updated and verified
- ✅ Documentation reviewed and complete
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained

## 📝 Migration Notes

- **Backward Compatible**: Existing project-specific setups continue to work
- **Optional Migration**: Users can choose to migrate to global setup
- **No Breaking Changes**: All existing functionality preserved

## 🎯 Next Steps

After merge:
1. Update main README.md to mention global setup option
2. Consider adding global setup as the default recommendation
3. Create video tutorial for global setup process
